The best R2 adjusted value of RandomForestRegressor is 0.8 is generally considered quite good on validation data. The R2 adjusted (or adjusted R-squared) is a modified version of the R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in the model. It provides a measure of the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables.

The R2 adjusted value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates that the independent variables explain all of the variation in the dependent variable, and a value of 0 indicates that the independent variables have no explanatory power.

As we can see RandomForestRegressor brings better results than other models.
